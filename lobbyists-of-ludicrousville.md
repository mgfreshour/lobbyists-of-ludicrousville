# Lobbyists of Ludicrousville

## Synopsis
You play as a lobbying corporation. The goal is to gain prestige. The jobs are bills your clients want passed. They pay you up front in money which you use to buy the resources of committee and general party votes.  End of the game, you lose prestige for any bill you took on you didn't complete (to balance the upfront money). Intrigue is, well intrigue, blackmail to take opponents resources, strip clubs to gain, etc. 

Themed as completely silly.  Though vaguely referencing real politics, completely made of stuff should be use so the game doesn't become dated to easily.

- ¿¿Extra Silly, all names are alliterative.
- ¿¿Themed lobbyist Corporations, providing some type of bonus/penalty to play.
- ¿¿The starting card is the lobbyists "back pocket" where all politicians are kept until used.
- ¿¿Two prestige trackers, one for each party - end game calculation a formula based on highest tracker.
- ¿¿Turns follow an election cycle, making things cheaper/more expensive (alternate to random events).

## Quests
Receive Money when accepting Quest.  Receive Prestige (Victory Points) when completing. Lose Prestige at the end of the game for any non-completed. Quests should balance the amount of money they provide up front and the amount of prestige they reward, so one will need to take a variety of quests, some that pay more than is needed to obtain the resources, some that are very prestigious but will require use of corporate money.

- ¿¿Themed so special intrigues/events affect them. Ex Controversial, Fundamental, Common Sense types??
- ¿¿Themed so different lobbying agencies have advantage taking them??
- ¿¿Counter offer, another player can "cancel" the completion by playing equivalent resources.  They get counter reward, originating player gets shafted.
